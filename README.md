# React Unit and Integration Testing

This is a repository adapting and following the concepts from Bruno Atune's series on React testing: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uKVFD_VMT8&list=PLYSZyzpwBEWTBdbfStjqJSGaulqcHoNkT&index=3&ab_channel=BrunoAntunes).

The difference is that I am using create-react-app whereas his project uses create-next-app so there is some adaptation on my part to make it work.
